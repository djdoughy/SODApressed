# SODApressed
Percussive Enveloping Noise Generator

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86516e90-1288-4a53-aa8a-ce37e2c71f63)


Features:

 -555 driven envelope

 -Triggerable by almost anything, at any length+

   -Attack cannot be retriggered until decay starts (this can make for some interesting half time hits if trigger is faster than attack time)

 -Transistor Noise generator

 -Beginner style DIY build

 -It's mostly analog!

Notes on building:
If you want a longer attack and decay, swap the capacitor on C5 from 4.7uF to 10uF (16V or larger)! Experiment! Have Fun!
